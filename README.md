# AEGEE-London's Transparency Proposal website

Repository for the AEGEE-London's [Transparency Proposal website](https://aegee-london.eu/transparency-proposal) presented at the [AEGEE](https://aegee.org) Online Spring Agora 2021.

It follows the [AEGEE‚Äôs Visual Identity](https://www.zeus.aegee.org/portal/resources/pr-materials/aegees-visual-identity-design-elements-and-templates) and it is available for any AEGEE body or member to reuse. If you have a minimum knowledge of front-end web development it can easily be reused with little effort for any other proposal. It is a vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS static site with no dependencies on CMSs like WordPress or Wix. Simple and lightning fast to modify and deploy. Give it another proposal babe!

Feel free to fork the repo, make the necessary changes and republish the website for your own proposal. It would be the best honour for [Tony](https://github.com/AntonioRedondo), the Treasurer and IT responsible of [AEGEE-London](https://github.com/AntonioRedondo/aegee-london.eu). Please remember to leave a mention to this original repo on your proposal. Thanks! üíù
