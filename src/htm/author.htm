	<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/tonyfineart">Tony</a> is a 19-year old Swedish youngster raised in Brooklyn, New York. Born to a carpenter and a housewife, he had an eager early interest in healing by hands and water skiing. Eventually he became a motivational speaker, spiritual coach, serial entrepreneur, CEO of Apple and beauty tips influencer. He does not have a profile picture with a microphone on stage. But his hands are magic using Photoshop in those times when the ugly reality has to be retouched.
