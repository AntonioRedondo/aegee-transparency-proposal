	<a href="#c2p1" class="link__icon" aria-label="c2p1" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>Let’s start by giving context. In December 2019 a relevant change happened in AEGEE: Google Workspace accounts (GW for brevity, <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/10075155" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formerly called G Suite</a>) would be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AEGEE.ITC/posts/2871534392865811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given for free</a> to any aegeean who wanted one. That was fantastic news for those who create content in AEGEE. GW is the best tool out there for online collaboration.

Firstly as said, the link was not set as public. And secondly, GW was being used for this kind of information.

	<a href="#c2p14b" class="link__icon" aria-label="c2p14b" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>Let’s ponder for a second about the full extent of the unjustified restrictions that AEGEE applies to its content and how this compares to similar organisations. In contrast to what AEGEE does, any company that trades in most stock exchanges around the world has to publish publicly a lengthy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual report</a> with its finances (<a href="https://abc.xyz/investor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>, <a href="https://investors.vodafone.com/reports-information/results-reports-presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vodafone</a>, <a href="https://www.ing.com/Investor-relations/Financial-performance/Annual-reports.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ING</a>). Not only that, this also applies to companies not publicly listed. The annual reports of <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any British limited company</a> are public. <i>But AEGEE is not a company</i> you may say. You are right, it is a NGO, which I assume to be even more transparent than a company. Let’s look at how other NGOs deal with transparency: <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/what-we-do/about/our-finances-and-accountability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxfam</a>, <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/who-we-are/finances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Cross</a> and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/our-finances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amnesty International</a>. Financial information open and voluntarily available on their own websites, in addition to the public and compulsory UK <a href="https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register of charities</a> (check <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/202918">Oxfam</a> on this registry). <i>But those are not the kind of NGO that AEGEE is</i>. Umm, let’s get more granular: is AIESEC something more similar to AEGEE? Find publicly its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://issuu.com/aiesecuk/docs/18.19_aiesec_uk_annual_report__spread_">financial information</a> (and in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/274779">UK Register of charities</a>). What about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://esn.org">ESN</a>? Even they are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://esn.org/annual-report">more transparent</a> than AEGEE! All of them publish reports and nice charts about the organisation's finances and other matters. And do not forget that most developed countries <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021">openly report finances, budgets and transparency reports</a>. <b>All this information being available on the Internet with a simple search and no registration whatsoever.</b> It is not an exaggeration to say that the majority of organisations of any kind in the world are more transparent than AEGEE.

	<a href="#c2p14c" class="link__icon" aria-label="c2p14c" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>The fallacy to restrict these big amounts of information is always the same: it is necessary because otherwise we overshare too much, at the same time that there is some legal impediment forcing us to do so (but those laws are never specified). AEGEE is obsessed with external risks jeopardising our integrity and freedom of speech (freedom of speech which is crushed by the same DPPS). But it has totally forgotten that <b>the biggest threats are internal</b>. Internal threats that from time to time make some rogue antenna treasurer or board to practise <i>creative accounting</i>. And same internal threats that caused an extraordinary Agora to happen in December. This is what actually poses a real legal risk for AEGEE and not <i>oversharing</i>.

	<a href="#c2p15" class="link__icon" aria-label="c2p15" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a><b>But when was it decided that AEGEE needed this three-level system to protect content? What is the goal of it?</b> The DPPS states in its Article 1 <i>Object and Purpose</i>:
</p>
<p class="mention">
	The purpose of this statement is <b>to secure right to privacy</b> of AEGEE members and other individuals, <b>with regard to</b>:<br/><br/>
	a) the gathering and automatic processing of personal data relating to them;<br/>
	b) the relationship between AEGEE-Europe, its Ordinary Members and third parties;<br/>
	<b>c) information and all relevant data about the Association, its work and its members.</b>

	<a href="#c2p16" class="link__icon" aria-label="c2p16" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>Point c) is the statement that closer relates to content generated by AEGEE. But I do not think it explains the purpose of the protection system. If we try to find more information, in Article 4.1 <i>Levels of protection of the data</i> we can read:
</p>
<p class="mention">
	Having in mind best practices and aiming <b>to guarantee due usage and corresponding levels of secrecy</b>, all the information of the Association shall be divided into external, internal, and internal confidential.

	– Keeping internal matters from the curious eye of the outsiders improves our internal freedom of speech.<br/>

However, restricting this information for the purpose of retaining partners does not affect our independence nor our FoS. Damn it, the meaning of <i>conflict of interests</i> evolves too quickly! The motion invents a new type of FoS: since this motion worsens the only FoS that exists, the one that you can use with anyone anytime anywhere, it creates the <i>internal</i> FoS, which is no more than the standard FoS but without the right to share information protected by the DPPS. Worried about financial information? It has nothing special. Talking about it should be normalised without accounts or restrictions. <b>Talking about it wherever and whenever is part of our freedom of speech.</b>

		❌ Since a few years ago AEGEE content –external or internal– is mostly not documented: if it is a PDF it does not have an introductory web page (like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aegeegoldentimes.eu/key-to-europe">this</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aegee.org/category/key-to-europe">this</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/portal/agora/agora-booklets-minutes">this</a>). And if it is web content it is missing key information like date, tags, categories, path or author (the case of <code>aegee.org</code>). Our content is so little documented that often the only way to know about its existence is by an email or a post on Facebook.

		❌ Much of AEGEE content is PDF stored in Google Drive. So it cannot be searched by a simple Google search (you only can search inside the AEGEE Materials Database if you are an AEGEE member and want to use a GW account, and not all content is in the Materials Database).

We can not just publish the entire CIA in HTML?<br><b>Update beginning 2022:</b> the CIA text has been moved from the now defunct public Members Portal in PDF to a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12UZ3xmF0q5hbUkUdUZ9OqaFahxtTUxOW">Google Drive</a>'s 🔒 Google Doc. However for some reason now you can not save or even copy text from the CIA document.

	<a href="#c2p61" class="link__icon" aria-label="c2p61" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>An organisation like AEGEE cannot afford to have such an unorganised way of documenting its existence. We need to improve the way we store our content. <b>A chaotic amalgamation of PDFs is one of those things that do look bad in front of partners.</b> It gives a subpar impression from an organisation that pretends to be serious about its job and mission. This proposal, together with the Knowledge Management System objective, is hopefully the beginning of a modern take on data management in AEGEE.
