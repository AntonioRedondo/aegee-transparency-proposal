	<a href="#c2p1" class="link__icon" aria-label="c2p1" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>Let’s start by giving context. In December 2019 a relevant change happened in AEGEE: Google Workspace accounts (GW for brevity, <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/10075155" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formerly called G Suite</a>) would be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AEGEE.ITC/posts/2871534392865811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given for free</a> to any aegeean who wanted one. That was fantastic news for those who create content in AEGEE. GW is the best tool out there for online collaboration.

Only if you are a member, and want to accept GW terms and conditions you are allowed to gain access to Agora booklets, candidate lists and election results.

Government announcements and access to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_gazette" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official journal</a> would be restricted to only French GW account holders to protect the freedom of speech of the country. Then the French government would restrict information about the national budget with the premise that such information being available publicly could hamper foreign investment in the country. This sounds more like North Korea. But remember, even when this parallelism looks too similar to what happens in AEGEE, we are still democratic and transparent, right?

	<a href="#c2p14b" class="link__icon" aria-label="c2p14b" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>Let’s ponder for a second about the full extent of the unjustified restrictions that AEGEE applies to its content and how this compares to similar organisations. In contrast to what AEGEE does, any company that trades in most stock exchanges around the world has to publish publicly a lengthy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual report</a> with its finances (<a href="https://abc.xyz/investor">Google</a>, <a href="https://investors.vodafone.com/reports-information/results-reports-presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vodafone</a>, <a href="https://www.ing.com/Investor-relations/Financial-performance/Annual-reports.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ING</a>). Not only that, this also applies to companies not publicly listed. The annual reports of <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any British limited company</a> are public. <i>But AEGEE is not a company</i> you may say. You are right, it is a NGO, which I assume to be even more transparent than a company. Let’s look at how other NGOs deal with transparency: <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/what-we-do/about/our-finances-and-accountability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxfam</a>, <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/who-we-are/finances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Cross</a> and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/our-finances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amnesty International</a>. Financial information open and voluntarily available on their own websites, in addition to the public and compulsory UK <a href="https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register of charities</a> (check <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/202918">Oxfam</a> on this registry). <i>But those are not the kind of NGO that AEGEE is</i>. Umm, let’s get more granular: is AIESEC something more similar to AEGEE? Find publicly its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://issuu.com/aiesecuk/docs/18.19_aiesec_uk_annual_report__spread_">financial information</a> (and in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/274779">UK Register of charities</a>). What about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://esn.org">ESN</a>? Even they are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://esn.org/annual-report">more transparent</a> than AEGEE! All of them publish reports and nice charts about the organisation's finances and other matters. And do not forget that most developed countries <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nzl">openly report finances, budgets and transparency reports</a>. <b>All this information being available on the Internet with a simple search and no registration whatsoever.</b> It is not an exaggeration to say that the majority of organisations of any kind in the world are more transparent than AEGEE.

	<a href="#c2p14c" class="link__icon" aria-label="c2p14c" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>The fallacy to restrict these big amounts of information is always the same: it is necessary because otherwise we overshare too much, at the same time that there is some legal impediment forcing us to do so (but those laws are never specified). AEGEE is obsessed with external risks jeopardizing our integrity and freedom of speech (freedom of speech which is crushed by the same DPPS). But it has totally forgotten that <b>the biggest threats are internal</b>. Internal threats that from time to time make some rogue antenna treasurer or board to practice <i>creative accounting</i>. And same internal threats that cause an extraordinary Agora to happen in December. This is what actually poses a real legal risk for AEGEE and not <i>oversharing</i>.

	<a href="#c2p15" class="link__icon" aria-label="c2p15" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a><b>But when was it decided that AEGEE needed this three-level system to protect content? What is the goal of it?</b> The DPPS states in its Article 1 <i>Object and Purpose</i>:
</p>
<p class="mention">
	The purpose of this statement is <b>to secure right to privacy</b> of AEGEE members and other individuals, <b>with regard to</b>:<br/><br/>
	a) the gathering and automatic processing of personal data relating to them;<br/>
	b) the relationship between AEGEE-Europe, its Ordinary Members and third parties;<br/>
	<b>c) information and all relevant data about the Association, its work and its members.</b>

	<a href="#c2p16" class="link__icon" aria-label="c2p16" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>Point c) is the statement that closer relates to content generated by AEGEE. But I do not think it explains the purpose of the protection system. If we try to find more information, in Article 4.1 <i>Levels of protection of the data</i> we can read:
</p>
<p class="mention">
	Having in mind best practices and aiming <b>to guarantee due usage and corresponding levels of secrecy</b>, all the information of the Association shall be divided into external, internal, and internal confidential.

However, restricting this information for the purpose of retaining partners does not affect our independence nor our FoS. Damn it, the meaning of <i>conflict of interests</i> evolves too quickly! The motion invents a new type of FoS: since this motion worsens the only FoS that exists, the one that you can use with anyone anytime anywhere, it creates the <i>internal</i> FoS, which is no more than the standard FoS but without the right to share information protected by the DPPS.

Also, the MedCom could publish every year a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://transparencyreport.google.com">transparency report</a> as part of its Activity Report, where, without giving specific details, it could tell the number of mediations requested, number of them open, closed and other related information.

<ol>

		<a href="#c2p40" class="link__icon link__icon--li" aria-label="c2p40" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a><b><i>Document the information about the item (the metadata) [...] in a consistent manner.</i></b><br/>
		❌ Since a few years ago AEGEE content –external or internal– is mostly not documented: if it is a PDF it does not have an introductory web page (like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aegeegoldentimes.eu/key-to-europe">this</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aegee.org/category/key-to-europe">this</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/portal/agora/agora-booklets-minutes">this</a>). And if it is web content it is missing key information like date, tags, categories, path or author (the case of <code>aegee.org</code>). Our content is so little documented that often the only way to know about its existence is by an email or a post on Facebook.

		❌ Much of AEGEE content is PDF stored in Google Drive. So it cannot be searched by a simple Google search (you only can search inside the AEGEE Materials Database if you are an AEGEE member and want to use a GW account, and not all content is in the Materials Database).

		❌ The format in which most of the content is created –PDF– complicates the way information can be found and searched, turning it into a not very efficient task. In PDF you only can search words. In HTML (and related data formats like XML and JSON) you can create interactive searching systems comparing different data sources (commonly known as Google).

By using HTML we can control and assure that a link clicked will open in the same or a new tab (we can instruct the browser either way). But with PDFs we cannot guarantee where the file will open. It may open on the browser. It may open on another programme. It may just download. Or –less likely yet possible– it may not open at all. It may open with pages screen-wide zoomed. Or maybe showing two pages fitted to screen. We do not have control over it. It is a small consideration. But in conjunction with the current restricted access of internal PDFs it diminishes the number of people enjoying our content.

This objective does not mention explicitly any issues with PDF content. But I can see here margin to include as one of the solutions a reduction in PDF content and an increase in HTML content.

And now the vast majority of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/how-government-works">British government</a> content is HTML.

	<a href="#c2p61" class="link__icon" aria-label="c2p61" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>An organisation like AEGEE cannot afford to have such an unorganised way of documenting its existence. We need to improve the way we store our content. <b>A chaotic amalgamation of PDFs is one of those things that do look bad in front of partners.</b> It gives a subpar impression from an organisation that pretends to be serious about its job and mission. This proposal, together with the Knowledge Management System objective, is hopefully the beginning of a modern take on data management in AEGEE.
