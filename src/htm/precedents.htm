	Precedents

<p>
	During previous Agoras the topic of external and internal information in AEGEE has been discussed directly or indirectly. I briefly enumerate the times this happened.

	2013 motion: Creating a policy for public and internal information
</h2>
<p>
	This motion presented at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/statutoryvote/jc/view_votings.php">Spring Agora Rhein-Neckar 2013</a> ðŸ”’ and meticulously analysed on the <a href="#c2p18">Too much restricted content</a> section is the reason why 8 years later this proposal is happening. It was the seed for the current DPPS, a policy that actually is necessary for an organisation like AEGEE, but whose restrictive and sketchy implementation of the <i>Data generated by AEGEE-Europe</i> section has margin for improvement.

<a href="img/image15a.png" target="_blank" title="Proposal screenshot">

<p>
	After extensive research by the Mediation Commission, during the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/statutoryvote/jc/view_votings.php">Spring Agora Patra 2014</a> ðŸ”’ the DPPS is extended with this propossal with the changes requested one year earlier in the 2013 motion.

	2017 motion: Motion of Oversharing: Improving communication within AEGEE
</h2>
<a href="img/image15b.png" target="_blank" title="Motion screenshot">
	<img src="img/image15b.png" class="image" alt="Motion screenshot" />
</a>
<p>
	This motion presented by AEGEE-Enschede at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/statutoryvote/jc/view_votings.php">Autumn Agora Catania 2017</a> ðŸ”’ (or <a href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/portal/cia-v-31-1" target="_blank">publicly available</a>) asked the MedCom to <i>supervise</i> the hundreds of social media accounts of all AEGEE bodies and antennas, and requested the CD to <i>outline comprehensive communication guidelines to protect our internal and external communication</i>.
</p>
<p>
	It seems AEGEE-Enschede was not aware of the existing DPPS dealing with the very same matter. I am not surprised. In 2017 the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IOg5hnbGmhgZ8pajYQgbY3CBTsETijS_">Materials Database</a> ðŸ”’ or the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://myaegee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HEL/pages/662864104/Data+Privacy+Policy+Statement+DPPS+of+AEGEE-Europe">Helpdesk</a> did not exist yet. So finding the <a href="#c2p7">Levels of Protection of Data</a> document was an impossible mission unless someone in AEGEE-Enschede had a copy of it.
</p>
<p>
	No further action happened after this motion.

	2018 motion: Motion to develop a new and safer strategy to share and acquire the internal budgets of Locals
</h2>
<a href="img/image15c.png" target="_blank" title="Motion screenshot">
	<img src="img/image15c.png" class="image" alt="Motion screenshot" />
</a>
<p>
	This motion presented at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/statutoryvote/jc/view_votings.php">Spring Agora Krakow 2018</a> ðŸ”’ (or <a href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/portal/cia-v-31-1" target="_blank">publicly available</a>) asked the Audit Commission to <i>strictly forbid the use of [sic] facebook for private information [...] and develop a new strategy or look for a platform to safely share these budgets</i>.
</p>
<p>
	Once again, no due diligence was carried out before writing this motion. If so, the author would have found out that what was asked in the motion already existed in the DPPS under the <i>Data collected from each AEGEE Local</i> section of the <a href="#c2p7">Levels of Protection of Data</a> document.
</p>
<p>
	We could argue that the reason for such a basic motion was because finding documentation in AEGEE is not an easy task (hence this proposal). Even when this is true it seems that the main reason for having such low-quality motions at Agoras is because most motions are barely thought for a moment, lack research and ask for things that are already done or are impossible to implement. They seem to be born out of spite as a reactionary move caused by a conflict between bodies. And since asking for things that will have to be done by someone else is free, motion writers go wild with the requested points.
</p>
<p>
	No further action happened after this motion.

	2020 objective: Knowledge Management System
</h2>
<p>
	Knowledge Management System was an objective of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aegeegoldentimes.eu/aegee-comite-directeur-list">ComitÃ© Directeur 58</a>'s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lbF9bri4LzYyHUbQIJuhrc0DG8KAIbMg">Activity Plan</a> ðŸ”’ (p13) from Autumn Agora 2020 to create a single unified platform for the AEGEE knowledge that at the moment it is stored in multiple fragmented platforms.
</p>
<p>
	This objective complements very well the spirit of this proposal to improve discoverability of our content by organising it a bit better.
</p>
<p>
	However, after or around the Online Agora Autumn 2021 two important things happened related to the Knowledge Management System:
</p>
<ul>
	<li class="link" id="c4p6">
		<a href="#c4p6" class="link__icon link__icon--li" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" aria-label="c4p6" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>
		The public <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/portal">Members Portal</a> was shut down and now redirects to MyAEGEE. All HTML content was killed. Public PDFs that could be found here (CIA, Working Formats, motions, Visual Identity, RTC and LTC toolkits) have been moved to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IOg5hnbGmhgZ8pajYQgbY3CBTsETijS_">Materials Database</a> ðŸ”’. But now this content has become Internal, when it has been External for more than 10 years. I proposed CD59â€™s President Teddy van Amelsvoort to <b>migrate this content to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aegee.org"><code>aegee.org</code></a> website instead of Google Drive</b> since both sites use WordPress and the content would remain public and discoverable. I was ignored. <b>Other content has directly been made unreachable</b>, like the one of the screenshot below.
	</li>
	<a href="img/image15cb.png" target="_blank" title="Former AEGEE Members Portal">
		<img src="img/image15cb.png" class="image" alt="Former AEGEE Members Portal" />
	</a>
	<p class="image__caption">
		RIP 2009-2022. Sorry Members Portal, you were too easy to access and navigate for AEGEE standards.
	</p>
	<li class="link" id="c4p7">
		<a href="#c4p7" class="link__icon link__icon--li" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" aria-label="c4p7" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>
			AEGEE <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aegee.blogactiv.eu">EurActive</a> blog has been shut down after being online for more than 10 years, with dozens of HTML articles in it. The content has not been migrated anywhere. There are still some remainings on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pr.euractiv.com/company/aegee-europe-92663">here</a>.
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="link" id="c4p8">
	<a href="#c4p8" class="link__icon" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" aria-label="c4p8" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>
	The Knowledge Management System has been executed in a way that we are now in a worse position than before this objective started. A lot of HTML content has been killed when it was perfectly fine (reportedly due to outdated content). And the remaining PDFs have been moved to a place where now it requires MyAEGEE and AEGEE GW accounts, content not being discoverable any more.
