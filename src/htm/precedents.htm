	Precedents
</h1>
<p>
	During previous Agoras the topic of using external and internal information in communications has been discussed directly or indirectly. I briefly enumerate the times this happened.

	2013. Creating a policy for public and internal information
</h2>
<p>
	This motion presented at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/statutoryvote/jc/view_votings.php">Spring Agora Rhein-Neckar 2013</a> 🔒 and <a href="#c2p18">previously analysed</a> is the reason why 8 years later this proposal is happening. It was the seed for the current DPPS, a policy that actually is necessary for an organisation like AEGEE, but whose restrictive and sketchy implementation of the <i>Data generated by AEGEE-Europe</i> section has margin for improvement.

	After extensive research by the Mediation Commission, during the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/statutoryvote/jc/view_votings.php">Spring Agora Patra 2014</a> 🔒 the DPPS is extended with this propossal with the changes requested one year earlier in the 2013 motion. <b>Data within AEGEE is hereafter classified as external, internal or confidential.</b>

	2017. Motion of Oversharing: Improving communication within AEGEE
</h2>
<img src="img/image15b.png" class="image" />
<p>
	This motion presented by AEGEE-Enschede at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/statutoryvote/jc/view_votings.php">Autumn Agora Catania 2017</a> 🔒 asked the MedCom to <i>supervise</i> the hundreds of social media accounts of all AEGEE bodies and antennas, and requested the CD to <i>outline comprehensive communication guidelines to protect our internal and external communication</i>.
</p>
<p>
	It seems AEGEE-Enschede was not aware of the existing DPPS dealing with the very same matter. I am not surprised. In 2017 the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IOg5hnbGmhgZ8pajYQgbY3CBTsETijS_">Materials Database</a> 🔒 or the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://myaegee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HEL/pages/662864104/Data+Privacy+Policy+Statement+DPPS+of+AEGEE-Europe">Helpdesk</a> did not exist yet. So finding the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xz9c-gEHgluP5ms-5leuYUk1catxYi76">Levels of Protection of Data</a> 🔒 document was an impossible mission unless someone in AEGEE-Enschede had a copy of it. No further action happened after this motion.

	2018. Motion to develop a new and safer strategy to share and acquire the internal budgets of Locals
</h2>
<img src="img/image15c.png" class="image" />
<p>
	This motion presented at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/statutoryvote/jc/view_votings.php">Spring Agora Krakow 2018</a> 🔒 asked the Audit Commission to <i>strictly forbid the use of [sic] facebook for private information [...] and develop a new strategy or look for a platform to safely share these budgets</i>.
</p>
<p>
	Once again, no due diligence was carried out before writing this motion. If so, the author would have found out that what was asked in the motion already existed in the DPPS under the <i>Data collected from each AEGEE Local</i> section of the <i>Levels of Protection of Data</i> document. As you can expect of a 95-word long text with poor requirements and non previous research, the motion was dead before it was even presented.
</p>
<p>
	We could argue that the reason for such a basic motion was because finding documentation in AEGEE is not an easy task (hence this proposal). Even when this is true it seems that the main reason for having such low-quality motions at Agoras is because most motions are barely thought for a moment, lack research and ask for things that are already done or are impossible to implement. They seem to be born out of spite as a reactionary move caused by a conflict between bodies. And since asking for things that will have to be done by someone else is free, motion writers go wild with the requested points.

	2020. Knowledge Management System
</h2>
<p>
	Knowledge Management System is an objective of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aegeegoldentimes.eu/aegee-comite-directeur-list">Comité Directeur 58</a>'s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lbF9bri4LzYyHUbQIJuhrc0DG8KAIbMg">Activity Plan</a> 🔒 (p13) from Autumn Agora 2020 to create a single unified platform for the AEGEE knowledge that at the moment it is stored in multiple fragmented platforms.
</p>
<p>
	This objective complements very well the intentions of this proposal to improve discoverability of our content by organising it a bit better.
