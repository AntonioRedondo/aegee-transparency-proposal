	So much information in the wild is dangerous
</h2>
<p>
	Because of the amount of it? Because of the content of it? Unless AEGEE has surreptitious activities and sabotages countries around the world like an agent of the CIA, or creates dodgy advertising campaigns like the media team of a political candidate, our internal content is as inoffensive as a two-week puppy. It has no industrial property, <a href="#c5p5">little personal data</a>, and at times it is so politically correct that if a crazy dude would dig deep into our content to find anything that remotely could be considered negative, polemic or fraudulent, it would be an absolute waste of time.

	Graphical representation of the level of risk that internal data poses for AEGEE after becoming external.
</p>
<p>
	Multibillion-worth ultra-complex and high security projects like the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> operating system are developed in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">open platforms</a> where even personal communications between developers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/corollari/linusrants">are</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linusrants">public</a>. But a student organisation several orders of magnitude smaller cannot cope with things like agora booklets being public, let alone minutes or financial information. A country needs to release this information to the open world to be considered democratic. So must do AEGEE if the organisation wants to stand by its roots and ask countries to be democratic.
</p>
<p>
	<b>But what about European Night pictures?</b> Possibly the most delicate information about you in AEGEE, I advocate for granting them fully confidential status. Gold Strike tastes too good. When you realise it is 50% vol it is already too late. üçæ‚ùåüì∏üëç

	So much information in the wild scares partners
</h2>
<p>
	Someone will have to create a strong case about which information scares which partners at which level, why that has to lead to collaterally restrict more content, and how come virtually every company, government and NGO out there is able to publish internal information freely yet AEGEE is not. AEGEE cannot sacrifice its freedom of speech or violate principles of transparency because hypothetically some of our internal data might not like to some private company or public institution. This is a massive conflict of interests for a NGO labelled itself as a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aegee.org/about-aegee"><i>democratic and political activist</i></a> organisation. So transgresor and combative for some things. Well conservative and conformist for others.
</p>

	What do you get by publishing so much information?
</h2>
<p>
	Wrong question. The right one is <i>What do you get by restricting so much information?</i>
</p>
<p>
	By being transparent in a proactive way we convey and gain trust from our members and society. In the same way that we want our political leaders to demonstrate their job with documents and facts enforced by law and not blind faith, so AEGEE should do as a democratic organisation. Being transparent is a way to distribute power among a bigger part of society so that decisions are more consensual and scrutiny can be asserted on a regular basis. The more people aware of AEGEE facts, the more people who can have an informed and educated opinion about us, no matter whether they are internal or externals to our organisation. <b>Transparency prevents abuse of power, corruption and misinformation, and helps organisations to be more refined and detect flaws earlier thanks to more people checking the relevant information.</b>
</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, let's not forget that once every long while there is some case of money mishandling by treasurers, boards or CDs, as these positions have special access to resources. Adding a layer of transparency would help to minimise and better handle these isolated cases when they occur. Pretending that these incidents do not ever happen and dealing with them <i>behind the doors</i> it is just the opposite of <a href="#c2p21">what AEGEE fights against</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I am just being a responsible, active and democratic citizen within AEGEE. Do you remember the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://morethaneducation.eu">More Than Education</a> ECI? I think it was a great initiative.

	The ITC and HRC have very little technical and human resources to implement these changes
</h2>
<p>
	This proposal requires no technical changes. It introduces the Format Content Guidelines ready to be followed by any body and individual who creates content in AEGEE (unlike many motions that ask AEGEE bodies for things but whose motion authors do not provide a clue about how to implement requested changes). It is not the responsibility of the ITC or the HRC to carry out the proposed changes. This proposal is about changing content management habits within AEGEE with the already existing tech infrastructure. It is not a technological change but a human behaviour one.

	<b>If we were in 1712 we would have the same dilemma</b> about this DPPS with 3 levels of protection. And at the same time it could be solved without waiting 300 years for computers and the internet to exist. Though certainly having internet would be extremely useful since we could add dozens of memes to our papyrus presentations.

	Do you pretend aegeeans to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript?
</h2>
<p>
	No. All this code is generated automatically when CMSs like WordPress, Wix or Blogger are used. <code>aegee.org</code> uses WordPress. Creating a section or article in <code>aegee.org</code> is as easy as writing and selecting text in Google Docs or Microsoft Word, and then pressing the <i>Publish</i> button.

	Are antennas affected by this proposal?
</h2>
<p>
	No. The two measures introduced in this proposal do not affect data generated by antennas, only data generated by AEGEE-Europe bodies.
</p>
<p>
	Although nothing stops an antenna to start following them and get a nice boost on transparency and data organisation. <a href="https://aegee-london.eu/#what-are-the-funds-used-for" target="_blank">We do it at AEGEE-London</a>.

	How changing some internal data generated by AEGEE to external is affected by the GDPR?
</h2>
<p>
	In nothing. GDPR is only concerned with personal data. The internal data that is moving to external barely contains personal data (usually name and AEGEE body, and I am not sure whether body can be considered personal data). <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection">GDPR</a> always gives you the right to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-to-get-copies-of-your-data">access</a>, restrict or block the use of your personal data in AEGEE generated content no matter whether it is external, internal or confidential.</b>
</p>
<p>
	If you think that letting the names of AEGEEans participating during Agoras as external is a too big of a compromise, then we should start prohibiting participants from publishing thousands of pictures on Facebook and Instagram during events (which is actually the case for <i>internal media</i> but obviously impossible to enforce). Then The Golden Times and The AEGEEan should start using fictitious names on every interview with a disclaimer at the top saying <i>Due to the AEGEE DPPS, real names of people appearing in this article are only available to AEGEE members.</i>

	I live in the People's Republic of Brexistan and I fear that I will be kicked in the arse if my government or employer finds out I am part of AEGEE
</h2>
<p>
	GDPR gives you the right to restrict or totally block the use of your personal data by AEGEE, no matter if it appears on external, internal or confidential content. At the same time, if you want to use a pseudonym in your content you should be allowed to do so.

	I am happy with how Google Workspace works. Why do you want AEGEEans to stop using it?
</h2>
<p>
	No one wants to stop anyone using GW. Everyone will be able to carry on using GW in AEGEE as it is done now. The only difference is that with this proposal most AEGEE content will be available without the need of a GW or a MyAEGEE account, and final distributable content will be in HTML rather than PDF. In fact, <b>this proposal has been written in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cMg2Y7Kfu_VrGkKiUMCaeaCGhQDTtO_ABSyxg_7XKUQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Docs file</a></b> since it allows to easily leave feedback on the document.

	If you do not want to use the GW account you just can ask someone to get you those internal documents you want
</h2>
<p>
	This is not only a cumbersome solution but ‚Äìmost importantly‚Äì <b>it is not compliant with the current DPPS.</b> If I ask someone to get these internal documents that means I would be accessing them without being authenticated or without even being a member, which is not in accordance with the DPPS, defeating its purpose.

	This website looks alright
</h2>
<p>
	<b>And it is available for anyone on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/AntonioRedondo/aegee-transparency-proposal">GitHub</a></b>. It also follows the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/portal/resources/pr-materials">AEGEE‚Äôs Visual Identity guidelines</a> (with some liberties) for best integration with the rest of AEGEE websites. If you have a minimum knowledge of front-end web development it can easily be reused with little effort for any other proposal. It is a vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS static site with no dependencies on CMSs like WordPress or Wix. Simple and lightning fast to modify and deploy. Give it another proposal babe!
