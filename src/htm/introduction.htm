	<a href="#c1p3" class="link__icon" aria-label="c1p3" title="Permalink to paragraph"><img class="link__image" src="img/permalink.svg" alt="Permalink icon" /></a>This creative deluge is phenomenal. A truly encouraging sign of the potential of young European generations. However as a result of the big amount of content created <b>classifying and making it effective, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoverability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discoverable</a> and maintainable over time becomes a challenge.</b>

	TL;DR
</h2>
<p>
	AEGEE unnecessarily restricts its content and overuses PDFs. This proposal amends the DPPS so that content is more accessible, organised and transparent, and introduces the Content Format Guidelines so that most of new AEGEE text content is stored in HTML instead of PDF.
</p>

	Protection level of some images of this proposal
</h2>
<p>
	Some of the images shown in this proposal are Internal according to the AEGEE Data Privacy Policy Statement (DPPS). That means that they should not be published publicly without logging in first with some AEGEE account.
</p>
<p>
	However, given the length of this proposal, for the sake of clarity I believe a few of these images are needed for a correct understanding.
</p>
<p>
	The fact that AEGEE Internal data is published publicly among AEGEE websites is one of the main subjects of this proposal. Most of the Internal images published in this proposal have already been published publicly by some other AEGEE body (you will find the link to the public source next to the link to the internal source).

	<b>ℹ️ Although they are not exactly the same, the terms <i>data</i>, <i>information</i> and <i>content</i> are used interchangeably among the proposal.</b>
</p>
<p class="info">
	<b>ℹ️ When you see a lock icon 🔒 next to a link you will need an AEGEE membership or AEGEE Google Workspace account to access the link.</b> (this proposal will hopefully change the need for this)
