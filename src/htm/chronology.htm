	May 2021, Spring Agora Online
</h2>
<p>
	The Agora at which the proposal was going to be introduced, <b>it finally did not happen.</b> The text was fully written and its website was online. But in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/statutoryvote">Online Voting System</a> ðŸ”’, in the section for proposals, I forgot to go through the <i>second screen</i>, which is only accessible after saving a draft of the proposal. I contacted the Juridical Commission (JC) as soon as the list of proposals was published and I saw that mine was missing. But since this happened 43 days before the Agora, and proposals must be in the system 45 days before, my proposal was not accepted. Rules are there to be followed. No exceptions!

	December 2021, Autumn Agora Online
</h2>
<p>
	Second round. This time I was ready to deal with the dreadful Online Voting System GUI. So well before the 45-day Autumn Agora deadline I went through the two screens of the Online Voting System and sent the proposal successfully. Then contacted the JC for feedback as per the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/12UZ3xmF0q5hbUkUdUZ9OqaFahxtTUxOW">Working Format of the Agora</a> ðŸ”’.
</p>
<p>
	It is here where the legal journey started. According to the DPPS, the only one who could modify the Levels of Protection of Data document as intended by my proposal was the Data Privacy Commission (DPC). But this commission was vacant at the time. I proposed then a small change to an article of the CIAâ€™s DPPS so that anyone and not only the DPC could modify this document. The JC said that that change could be suggested, but before the Levels of Protection of Data document could be modified the change to the CIAâ€™s article would have to be ratified by the Agora. The JC suggested that, in order to have both things happening in the same Agora, at the opening plenary I would have to ask for an exception to vote on the article change first thing, and then, if ratified, voting on the document changes. This was not feasible as this proposal is long and complex, and it specially relies on feedback from members. I just wanted to follow the conventional proposal procedure. <b>For a second time, voting the proposal was not going to happen.</b>
<p>
<p>
	At this Agora, <b>only <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zeus.aegee.org/statutoryvote/jc/view_public.php?proposal_id=541">the small change</a> ðŸ”’ to the CIAâ€™s DPPS article was voted upon.</b> The change was ratified by the Agora. And now, any ordinary member can propose modifications to the Levels of Protection of Data document. Yeih? ðŸ™„

<p>
	<b>Third timeâ€™s a charm?</b> At the moment this proposal is being discussed with the JC and the DPC to be polished for its vote at the Spring Agora Novi Sad 2022.
